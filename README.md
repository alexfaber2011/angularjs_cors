# Angular.js -> Node.js / Express Across Domains

Very small Angular.js app that points to another Node/Express instance as a reference to how to get CORS to work nicely.

I have another repository (which holds the Node/Express app) [here](https://github.com/alexfaber2011/node_express_cors) 
where you can see how the two get along.
